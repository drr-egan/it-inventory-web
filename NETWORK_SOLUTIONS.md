# üîß Network Access Solutions - External Device Access

## üéØ **Problem Identified**
Your IT Inventory Management app is accessible locally but not from external devices on the network.

**Root Cause:** WiFi Access Point (AP) Isolation is enabled on your router/WiFi network.

---

## üîß **Solutions (Try in Order)**

### **Solution 1: Disable WiFi AP Isolation (Recommended)**

1. **Access your router admin panel:**
   - Open browser and go to: **http://172.22.71.1**
   - Login with router admin credentials

2. **Find and disable AP isolation:**
   - Look for settings under names like:
     - "AP Isolation"
     - "Client Isolation" 
     - "Wireless Isolation"
     - "Station Isolation"
     - "Guest Network" restrictions

3. **Disable the isolation setting**

4. **Restart router** (optional but recommended)

5. **Test access from another device:** http://172.22.71.200:8080

---

### **Solution 2: Use Wired Connection**

1. **Connect your server to router via Ethernet cable**
2. **Your app will remain accessible via the current IP**
3. **Wired connections typically don't have isolation restrictions**

---

### **Solution 3: Create Dedicated WiFi Network**

1. **Set up a separate WiFi network** (if your router supports it)
2. **Disable AP isolation on the new network**
3. **Connect all devices to the new network**

---

### **Solution 4: Temporary Firewall Override**

If you need immediate access while working on router settings:

```bash
# Allow access from your local network range
sudo ufw allow from 172.22.71.0/24 to any port 8080
sudo ufw allow from 172.22.71.0/24 to any port 3000
sudo ufw enable
```

## üß™ **Quick Test Methods**

### **Test 1: Ping Test**
From another device on the network, try:
```bash
ping 172.22.71.200
```
- ‚úÖ **If ping works:** Router allows basic communication
- ‚ùå **If ping fails:** AP isolation is definitely enabled

### **Test 2: Browser Test**
From another device, open: **http://172.22.71.200:8080**

### **Test 3: Command Line Test**
From another device:
```bash
curl -s http://172.22.71.200:8080/ | head -10
```
